## Streamlining DoD Cloud Adoption with AWS Infrastructure as Code

Adopting cloud services in the Department of Defense (DoD) can be a lengthy process. Mission owners must build complex environments, implement security models, provide common services, connect to Cloud Access Points (CAPs), and get an Authority to Operate (ATO) for their workloads. The DoD Cloud Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for AWS aims to speed up this digital transformation with a secure, cost-effective deployment method.

### What is DoD Cloud IaC for AWS?
DoD Cloud IaC for AWS is a baseline setup that helps mission owners quickly deploy a secure, scalable, multi-account environment following AWS best practices. This setup creates a compliant environment for deploying mission systems, building software, and migrating data. It includes controls to ensure compliance with NIST 800-53/DISA Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (CC SRG) controls and provides automated assessment and reporting.

Using pre-configured, pre-authorized templates, the DoD Cloud IaC for AWS helps DoD organizations create cloud environments quickly, allowing them to adopt the cloud for workloads up to Impact Level 5. This results in faster delivery of innovative cloud platform services to the Warfighter. The solution includes a three-year ATO from DISAâ€™s Risk Management Executive (RME), inheriting 103 Common Controls and 295 Control Correlation Identifiers (CCI), significantly reducing the assessment burden for mission owners.

The DoD Cloud IaC for AWS allows customers to leverage higher-level AWS managed services, reducing the workload for mission owners and increasing inherited controls from the cloud provider. This decentralized approach provides the flexibility to deploy on AWS account IDs directly owned and controlled by mission owners.

### How does DoD Cloud IaC for AWS add value?
The DoD faces unique and challenging use cases requiring creative solutions. The DoD Cloud IaC for AWS provides a stable foundation that supports a wide variety of solutions, allowing mission owners to build secure, scalable systems without restricting innovation. With over 103 Common Controls and 295 Control Correlation Identifiers (CCI) approved, it significantly accelerates the authorization process for mission owners.

### Who benefits from using DoD Cloud IaC for AWS?
The DoD Cloud IaC for AWS benefits:
- **Cloud brokers/account owners**: Offers a multi-tenant landing zone with compliance guardrails.
- **Mission owners**: Provides a compliant baseline infrastructure for deploying workloads and migrating data.
- **Compliance assessors and ISSOs**: Features a dashboard showing cloud environment compliance with DISA CC SRG, along with auditing and monitoring tools.
